So, we will learn here what is a P-Value and what it does. Let me explain in a very simple way?
Perfect — let’s make the **p-value** so simple that even a 10-year-old could get it 

---

# Imagine this:

You’re flipping a coin.
Normally, a fair coin gives **heads** and **tails** about half the time each.

Now suppose your friend says:

> “I think this coin is *lucky* — it gives more heads than tails!”

So you test it:
You flip it 10 times…
and it lands on **heads 9 times!**

You’re like  “Whoa, that’s weird! Maybe it *is* lucky?”

But before you believe your friend, you ask yourself:
 “Could this just be *luck* even if the coin is normal?”

---

# That’s where the **p-value** comes in.

The **p-value** answers this question:

> “If the coin were actually fair, what’s the *chance* I’d see results this extreme (9 heads out of 10) just by luck?”

---

# So:

* If that chance (p-value) is **very small**, say less than 5% (0.05),
  you say: “This is too unlikely to be just luck. Maybe the coin *is* special.”
* If it’s **big**, like 30%, you say: “Eh, it could easily happen by chance — probably a normal coin.”

---

# In one line:

> The **p-value** tells you how *surprised* you should be if your result happened by chance.

* Small p-value → “Whoa! That’s surprising! Maybe something real is going on.”
* Big p-value → “Nah, that could easily happen. Probably just luck.”

---

# Kid-friendly summary:

> A p-value is like asking,
> “If everything were normal, how likely is it I’d see something this weird?”
