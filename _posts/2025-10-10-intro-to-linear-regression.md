Here we will learn about linear regression which is one of the basic algorithm of supervised machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where systems learn and improve from data without explicit programming.

Machine Learning are of three main types-  Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning

In this post, we’ll explore how it works, what assumptions it makes, and how to implement it in Python.

# Linear Regression
- In basic terms it is - Imagine you have a bunch of dots on a piece of paper. Each dot shows how tall a plant grew depending on how much water it got. Now, you take a ruler and try to draw one straight line that goes as close as possible to all those dots.
That line helps you guess how tall a new plant might grow if you give it a certain amount of water.

 “So, linear regression is just finding the best straight line through some dots, so we can make good guesses!”
- It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning and statistics.

It helps us understand how one variable (the *dependent variable*) changes when another variable (the *independent variable*) changes.

## 🧩 What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression tries to fit a **straight line** through a set of data points in such a way that the **sum of squared errors** (the distances from each point to the line) is minimized.

Mathematically, the line is represented as:

\[
y = β_0 + β_1x + ε
\]

where:
- \( y \) = dependent variable  
- \( x \) = independent variable  
- \( β_0 \) = intercept  
- \( β_1 \) = slope of the line  
- \( ε \) = error term

Excellent — now we’ll go one level deeper and get the **mathematical intuition** behind linear regression, without jumping straight into formulas.

Let’s build the idea step by step 👇

---

### 🌱 Step 1: The goal

We have some data — points like
[
(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)
]
For example:

* (x) = number of study hours
* (y) = exam marks

We believe that **as study hours increase, marks increase in a roughly straight-line way**.

So we want a **line** that best describes this relationship:
[
\hat{y} = m x + c
]
where

* (m) is the **slope** (how much (y) changes if (x) increases by 1)
* (c) is the **intercept** (the predicted (y) when (x = 0))

---

### 🎯 Step 2: The idea of “best line”

Not all lines will fit the data equally well.
So we measure **how far off** our line’s predictions are from the actual points.

For each data point:
[
\text{error}_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = y_i - (m x_i + c)
]

We don’t just want the errors to cancel out (some positive, some negative),
so we square them (to make all positive):
[
\text{Squared Error}_i = (y_i - (m x_i + c))^2
]

Then, add them all up:
[
\text{Total Error} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (m x_i + c))^2
]

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Minimizing the error

The goal is to find the **values of** (m) and (c) that make this total error as **small as possible**.

This is called the **method of least squares**.

So mathematically, linear regression solves:
[
\min_{m,c} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (m x_i + c))^2
]

That’s an optimization problem — and when you take partial derivatives with respect to (m) and (c) and set them to zero,
you get formulas for the best (m) and (c).

---

### 🧠 Step 4: Intuition of slope and intercept

* The **slope (m)** is how much (y) changes *on average* when (x) increases by one unit.
* The **intercept (c)** is the average value of (y) when (x) is zero.

So the line we find is the one that gives the **best average prediction** of (y) for a given (x).

---

### 💡 Step 5: Broader intuition

Linear regression is about:

* **Finding patterns** between variables.
* **Summarizing data** with the simplest possible model (a straight line).
* **Predicting future outcomes** based on those patterns.

If you’d like, I can show you how that “best line” emerges visually — first with random points, then the line minimizing squared error. Would you like me to?

## 📊 Example in Python

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print("Coefficient:", model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
```
